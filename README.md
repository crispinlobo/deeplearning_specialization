# deeplearning_specialization
In a series of five courses, this specialization explainated the foundations of Deep Learning,  how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. Some of the topics covered include Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more.This specialization also covered case studies in domain of healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. Important frameworks such as tensorflow and keras were covered in great detail.
